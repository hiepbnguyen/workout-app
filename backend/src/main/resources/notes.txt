Controller contains API endpoints

Models contains ORM data objects for the database
Service contains the business logic between the repository and the Controller
Repository contains the interface for the database, including queries

Security contains configurations for authentication and authorization
    "SecurityUser" implements "UserDetails" in a way where it uses data from the "Account" class to authenticate users
    SecurityUserDetailService implements a method for getting the SecurityUser via a username
    The SecurityUserDetailService is then wrapped into the SecurityFilterChain as a UserDetailService

    The SecurityConfigs contains configs for cors, the security filter chain, authentication manager, and the password encoder.

Use RestClient instead of RestTemplate. Use WebClient for async or streaming services.
